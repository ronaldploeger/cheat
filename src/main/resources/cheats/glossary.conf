For Internet traffic specifically, a Layer 4 load balancer bases the load-balancing decision on the source and destination IP addresses and ports recorded in the packet header, without considering the contents of the packet. When the Layer 4 load balancer receives a request and makes the load balancing decision, it also performs Network Address Translation (NAT) on the request packet, changing the recorded destination IP address from its own to that of the content server it has chosen on the internal network. Similarly, before forwarding server responses to clients, the load balancer changes the source address recorded in the packet header from the server’s IP address to its own."
